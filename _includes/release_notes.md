**The mammoth release**. This release contains an amazing 212 commits over version 1.3.1 - almost doubling the total commit count. I think smaller releases are called for in the future!

I'd like to send a giant thanks to everyone who's been testing the pre-release channel and reporting bugs. Without all your testing this release wouldn't have been possible!

### Breaking change
Windows uses upgrading from 1.3.6 earlier will need to uninstall WMail before upgrading. Not doing this will result in two WMail installs. [More information](https://github.com/Thomas101/wmail/wiki/Windows-users-upgrading-to-2.0.0)

# Upgrades

* Updated to chrome 53

# User Interface
* Detecting when you launch WMail in an offline state and showing a splash screen rather than a broken WMail
* Consistent Windows app icon (no more pixelation! Woo!)
* Changed the layout of the settings screen to use the available screen space

* Removed excess top space from side-menu on linux, windows and when the toolbar is enabled
* Added Restart button when you change a setting that requires an app restart
* Added preview of hovered link address
* Add option to set your own CSS and JavaScript on a per mailbox basis. So if you want everything red... you can have everything red ðŸ˜€
* Unread count over app icon for Ubuntu users using Unity
* Better update dialog and a more robust backend so I can stage the releases
* Update check always happens daily now. Option to disable this

# Notifications

# Other Features
* Support for 38+ dictionary languages! Bonjour, Hola, Hallo!

# Bugs
* Fixed sidemenu toggle shortcut on windows & linux

* Fixed toolbar disappearing on windows & linux
* Removed Open links in background for platforms that donâ€™t support it
* Disabled multiple-account menu items when there is only one account
* Downloads now add the file extension even if the user omits it

# Bundling
* The packaging script now automatically creates the distribution files for each platform
* Windows now has separate 32 and 64 bit builds
* OSX has a brand new dmg rather than just zipping the folder up
* Windows uses a non proprietary installer
* Tar linux builds rather than zip for better compression
* Deb packages for linux

# Code
* Code has been restructured into 3 main packages. The primary package, main app and mailboxes window. Because of this I've been able to remove a lot of dead code that was shipping in the production build. This has reduced file size and decreased build time. Here' some fancy stats
 * Production filesize 17% smaller (164mb to 136mb)
 * 95% reduction in files (9878 to 415)
* Dependencies have been updated
* Startup process looks a fair bit cleaner with UI placeholders
* Moved the database from localstorage to a centralised app database
 * This means data is available throughout the app and database duplication has been removed
 * The main thread has direct access to the data and listens on changes directly
 * The models are now common between the main and rendering thread for reduced code duplication
* The kitchen sink has been taken out of `app.js` to make code more maintainable
* Renamed Google Mailbox to WMail on Google Services
* Split the GoogleMailbox view to use a common WebView that deals with the nasties of managing its state
* Refactored the webview injection code to be more modular and extensible
* Removed multiple instances of dom thrashing in the webview injection code. This should speed up start times
